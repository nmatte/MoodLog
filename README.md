# MoodLog

This is a personal project for Android. It is designed after the BEAM mood chart used in treatment of mood disorders.

Its function is to allow users to record certain information about their day.

The chart has a degree of customizability. While the user can recreate the original chart, they can also extend it.

#Features

* There are "modules" which represent more complicated data such as the mood section on the original chart. A mini version is also available.
* Add numeric fields like hours of sleep
* Add checkboxes, such as for medication
* Record longer text notes
* Set a custom date range; view past entries
