# MoodLog

This is a personal project for Android. It is designed after the BEAM mood chart used in treatment of mood disorders.

Its function is to allow users to record certain information about their day:

* mood level(s) varying from -6 to +6
  
* the hours they slept the night before
  
* anxiety level
  
* irritation level
  
* whether they took certain medications

It will allow users to track their logs over a 28-day period.
